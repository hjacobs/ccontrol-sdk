This ccontrol development tools collection is what people call a weekend hack.
Userfriendlyness is kept to a minimum and I wouldnt be surprised if there are 
tons of bugs. 

Read the INSTALL file.
To compile a programm type "ccbasic hello.bas" where hello.bas is your program
name.
This should generate a file called hello.dat (or whatever your program's name is .dat)
To upload the file to the ccontrol unit type ccupload -f hello.dat -d /dev/ttySx
where /dev/ttySx is the device to which your ccontrol unit is connected.
Please notice that if you chose the wrong device the programm might just hang
without giving you an error message.
Try a different ttyS if that happens.
The ccdownload is just for testing purposes, it dumps a program from the cc unit.
Note that it just dumps the byte code, not a dat file and not a cc basic code.
With the assembler you can assemble mc68hc705b16 assembly. Read conrad's ccbasic
manual on how to include those files into your programm.
(I was successful doing this using the ccbasic samples provided by conrad)
