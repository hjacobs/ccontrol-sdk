Make sure you have removed all carriage returns from your source file with 
the dos2unix tool in the bin/ directory.

The assembler has originally been developed for dos like 8.3 filenames, so 
please be prepared to face some bugs of this nature :-)
A known bug is that filename.asm and filename.asm-other both have a 
filename.s19 as default output.
There might exist a some other bugs being caused by the same problem.

Be very careful with your code formatting.
Not applying the "label <empty space> operator <empty space> operand" format
can cause the assembler crash or even compile unpredicatble.

Redefinable symbols end with a @.
Wrong		Right
blah equ 3	blah@ equ 3
blah equ 4 	blah@ equ 4

Comments begin with a * or a ;
If you want to use the ascii value of ; then type \;

Include files end with an 'end' at the operator field ("<tab>end").
You can nest at most 30 include files.
